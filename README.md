# Computer Measuring Instrument

This repository collects utilities and documentation for a computer-based
measuring instrument project. The original README heading accidentally included
an extra trailing hyphen (`Computer-Measuring-Instrument-`), which prevented the
project title from rendering cleanly on platforms such as GitHub and made the
generated anchor link for the heading inconsistent with the repository name.

## Overview

The project aims to provide tooling and reference material for managing data
acquired from electronic measuring instruments. As the codebase evolves, this
README will continue to document how to build, test, and extend the tooling.

## Documentation Guidelines

When referencing files in documentation, wrap file names in backticks instead
of using the `@filename` placeholder. This ensures that filenames display
correctly in Markdown renderers and avoids confusing readers with editor-only
notations.
